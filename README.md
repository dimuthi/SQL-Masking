# SQL-Masking

This Support pack allow the user to mask sensitive data fields in SQL databases such as Name of a Person ,Date of Birth, Dates and Times, Postal Codes , Postal Addresses, Telephone Numbers ,National Identity Numbers, Blood Group of a Person, Price Values and Personal Images such that the data will not reveal any personal information whilst maintaining the realistic nature of the data fields (For example a telephone number will be masked with a valid fake telephone number). Each masking method contains 2 stored procedures,namely atomic stored procedure and wrapper stored procedure. The objective of these 2 methods are explained in the section below; 

Atomic stored Procedure     - Generates an output value according to the required data field's format (For example a random telephone number will be generated by using the atomic stored procedure related to  masking telephone numbers).

Wrapper stored Procedure  - Masks the data in an entire column with masked data values relevant to the particular data field in that column (For example the telephone number column will be masked with valid yet fake telephone numbers by using the wrapper stored procedure related to masking telephone numbers).
